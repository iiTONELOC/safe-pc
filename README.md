## Description

This repository is under active development as part of a senior **Capstone Project** in Cybersecurity Engineering.  

The goal of ***SAFE-PC*** is to demonstrate the feasibility of repurposing obsolete PCs into automated, cost-effective security appliances while simultaneously addressing the growing challenge of electronic waste.  

This project emphasizes:  

- Sustainable IT practices  
- Practical deployment of open-source security tools  
- Academic research into cost-effective defensive frameworks  

## Academic Context

This repository represents the **hands-on implementation component** of a Cyber Operations - Engineering emphasis Capstone Project at the **University of Arizona**. The accompanying thesis explores the broader academic context, while this repository demonstrates a working framework for turning theory into practice.  

## Overview

As Windows 10 reaches end-of-life and millions of PCs face obsolescence, this project demonstrates that these devices can be repurposed into automated, cost-effective **security appliances**, commonly referred to as **UTM** (*Unified Threat Management*) devices, using open-source technologies and virtualization.  

The motivation is twofold: 

1. **Windows 10 End of Support:** Microsoft will end support for Windows 10 in **October 2025**, leaving millions of still-functional PCs labeled as ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù and destined for e-waste.  

2. **Security Gaps for Consumers and SMBs:** Most homeowners and small-to-medium businesses rely on **basic ISP-provided hardware** that offers little more than NAT (Network Address Translation) with minimal defensive capability.  

By leveraging **Proxmox** for virtualization and **Ansible** for automation, SAFE-PC integrates open-source security tools into legacy PCs, turning them into practical cybersecurity appliances that extend hardware lifecycles and reduce e-waste.

## Why This Research Matters

The **end of Windows 10 support** will create an unnecessary surge of e-waste as otherwise functional PCs are retired. At the same time, **cyber-attacks against consumers and SMBs** are rising, and many continue to depend on low-cost ISP or consumer-grade hardware with almost no real security features.  

**SAFE-PC bridges these challenges by:**  

- Repurposing legacy PCs into **dedicated security appliances** rather than discarding them.  
- Deploying academically sound, open-source security tools within a Proxmox environment on repurposed hardware.  
- Delivering **affordable, accessible security** to households and SMBs traditionally underserved by enterprise-grade solutions.  

SAFE-PC demonstrates that **sustainability and cybersecurity can reinforce each other**.

## Project Goals

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Reduce E-Waste:** Extend the life of PCs that would otherwise be discarded.  
- üîí **Enhance Security:** Provide better defenses than consumer-grade routers.  
- üí∞ **Increase Accessibility:** Enable cost-effective security solutions for small organizations and homes.  
- üåç **Sustainable IT:** Bridge the gap between environmental responsibility and cybersecurity readiness.
